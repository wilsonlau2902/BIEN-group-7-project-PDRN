## 🌿 About DermaNova

DermaNova is a revolutionary bioengineering startup that pioneers sustainable skincare through **algae-based PDRN (Polydeoxyribonucleotide)** technology. Our innovation replaces traditional salmon-derived PDRN with an ethical, sustainable, and equally effective plant-based alternative.

### The Innovation

- **100% Plant-Based**: Derived from marine algae
- **Sustainable Production**: Zero harm to marine life
- **Proven Efficacy**: Equivalent or superior skin regeneration properties
- **Ethical Choice**: Completely vegan and cruelty-free

## 🔬 Project Background

This project is developed by **Group 7** as part of the BIEN (Bioengineering) program. Our mission is to revolutionize the skincare industry by providing sustainable alternatives to animal-derived ingredients while maintaining or exceeding their effectiveness.

### Key Features

1. **Algae-Based PDRN Extraction**: Proprietary process to extract high-purity polynucleotides from marine algae
2. **Skin Regeneration**: Stimulates fibroblast activity and collagen synthesis
3. **Anti-Aging Properties**: Reduces fine lines and improves skin elasticity
4. **Environmental Impact**: 50% lower carbon footprint compared to salmon-based alternatives
5. **Scalable Production**: Cost-effective manufacturing process
